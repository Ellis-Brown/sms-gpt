# AGI Texting
The beginning of General Artificial Intellegence, which you can text/WhatsApp/imessage from your phone. The plan is to include multi-modal input and output, over multiple texting apps, and allow for subscription based models with different tiers to fund the cost of daily use. 

Mostly, the ideas of implementation are on my iPad or in my head, I'm just putting this here and the link to my twitter post (https://twitter.com/ellisbrown_code/status/1637977036978307073) as a beginning of a discussion. 

If you are working on a similar project, please reach out to me at `ellis.brown@tufts.edu`. 

> This is a very informally put together and documented repository / twitter thread, I just ran out of time at the moment.
